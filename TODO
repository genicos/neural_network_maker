I gotta make at least two versions of in placeable operations, 
    the in place version and the not in place version
    Sometimes the input will be used for more operations, in that case
    I should not use in place


Optimization
    multiple additions in a row
    multiple scales in a row
    multiple full in a row
    multiple conv in a row
